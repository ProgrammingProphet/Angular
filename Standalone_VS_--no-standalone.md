# Standalone vs Non-Standalone in Angular

Angular introduced the concept of **standalone components** starting with version 14, offering developers a new way to structure Angular applications. This feature eliminates the necessity of Angular modules (`NgModule`) in specific scenarios, simplifying the overall development process.

Below, we delve into the differences between standalone and non-standalone components and explore their usage in Angular development.

## What is a Standalone Component?
A **standalone component** in Angular is a component that is self-contained and does not require being declared inside an `NgModule`. It is designed to work independently, making it easier to build smaller and modular applications.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Standalone components directly import their dependencies (e.g., directives, pipes, or other components).
- They can be bootstrapped without being part of an `NgModule`.
- Useful for building lightweight and modular features.

### **Syntax:**
To create a standalone component, use the `standalone: true` property in the component decorator:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-standalone',
  standalone: true,
  template: `<h1>This is a standalone component</h1>`
})
export class StandaloneComponent {}
```

## What is a Non-Standalone Component?
A **non-standalone component** is a traditional Angular component that must be declared within an `NgModule`. This approach has been a part of Angular since its inception and is suited for larger applications requiring a structured module hierarchy.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- Must be declared in the `declarations` array of an `NgModule`.
- Dependencies like pipes and directives are managed through `NgModule` imports.
- Essential for applications with complex module dependencies.

### **Syntax:**
Here’s an example of a non-standalone component:
```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-non-standalone',
  template: `<h1>This is a non-standalone component</h1>`
})
export class NonStandaloneComponent {}
```
Then, declare it in an `NgModule`:
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { NonStandaloneComponent } from './non-standalone.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [NonStandaloneComponent],
  exports: [NonStandaloneComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Key Differences Between Standalone and Non-Standalone Components

| Feature                  | Standalone Component                   | Non-Standalone Component            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Declaration**          | No `NgModule` required                | Must be declared in an `NgModule`  |
| **Dependencies**         | Directly imported in the component    | Managed through the `NgModule`     |
| **Use Case**             | Simple or modular apps                | Larger apps with complex structures|
| **Bootstrapping**        | Can be directly bootstrapped          | Requires an `NgModule` to bootstrap|
| **Simplification**       | Reduces boilerplate code              | More structured for large projects |

## When to Use Each Approach

### **Use Standalone Components When:**
- Building small or modular applications.
- Developing isolated components for reuse across multiple applications.
- Prototyping or testing new features quickly.

### **Use Non-Standalone Components When:**
- Developing large-scale enterprise applications with complex dependencies.
- Requiring consistent structure for teams familiar with the `NgModule` approach.
- Managing shared resources across multiple components.

## Example: Combining Standalone and Non-Standalone Approaches
In many cases, developers can mix standalone and non-standalone components within the same application. For instance:

- Use standalone components for isolated features or utilities.
- Use non-standalone components for core modules and shared resources.

```typescript
// Standalone component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-header',
  standalone: true,
  template: `<header>Header Component</header>`
})
export class HeaderComponent {}

// Non-standalone component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-footer',
  template: `<footer>Footer Component</footer>`
})
export class FooterComponent {}

@NgModule({
  declarations: [FooterComponent],
  bootstrap: [FooterComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

Angular’s introduction of standalone components simplifies the framework’s complexity and gives developers flexibility in structuring their applications. The choice between standalone and non-standalone approaches depends on the specific requirements and scale of the project.
